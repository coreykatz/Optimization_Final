# Optimization Final
This is my portion of a final project for an Optimization course taken in Fall 2018. This purpose of this project was to approximate probability density functions of unknown distributions. I focused on interpolation and polynomial regression on histograms. The .py file contains my functions to implement my methods and the second file is my portion of the report.
